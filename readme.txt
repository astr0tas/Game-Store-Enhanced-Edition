The client is using ReactJS so in order to run the client, first you need to go to the `client` directory, simple type: `cd client`, and then type: `npm i` to install all the necessary libraries, and finally type: `npm start` to run the react app.

The database is MySQL server so you just need to run the .sql files in MySQL Workbench or anything else that support MySQL server.

The server is using XAMPP so you will need to put the content of the `server` folder into your XAMPP root directory (default is C:/xampp/htdocs) to establish the server.
