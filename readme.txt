The client is using ReactJS so in order to run the client, first you need to go to the `client` directory, simple type: `cd client`, and then type: `npm i` to install all the necessary libraries, and finally type: `npm start` to run the react app.

The database is MySQL server so you just need to run the .sql files in MySQL Workbench or anything else that support MySQL server.

The server is using XAMPP so you will need to put the content of the `server` folder into your XAMPP root directory (default is C:/xampp/htdocs) to establish the server.

P/S: 
- This project is just a prove of concept and also my first ever website that I built solo, no real deployment ever needed so there are several important features that I didn't include such as registering, loging using google account or linking with banks for real purchases.
- The project still has some bugs and weird behaviors but they're minors and don't affect much and it also doesn't send http status code accordingly.
- The website itself doesn't have anything protection methods to prevent threats like SQL Injection, XSS, etc...
These problems and kinks can be fixed but since I really don't have time so I'm just leaving them there. Afterall, this is just a project to better my understanding of how a website works.
